### Twitter
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1171171187248041984
> "Copperhead was a former sponsor of the project, and agreed to support it as an independent open source project under my control. Copperhead never owned the code. It was not written for them and was never assigned to them. This was part of a very explicit arrangement I required."

> "Unfortunately, the CEO of Copperhead (James Donaldson) is a scam artist with a criminal background. He ended up breaking the terms of agreements and attempting to seize control and ownership of the project, including attempting to compromise the security of the people using it."

> "He seized control over the infrastructure, stole all the donations and began his attempts to destroy the project which are still ongoing today. He's spreading lies about the project and myself on a daily basis and still attempting to do whatever he can to continue causing damage."

> "James was only ever interested in using the project and myself to line his pockets with money through whatever means possible. Copperhead was run in a highly unethical and irregular way. He pursued and signed deals with criminal organizations and tried to sell out to governments."

> "Near the end of Copperhead's involvement, James was pursuing a deal with a US military contractor. He told me he needed to provide access to infrastructure and signing keys so they could "audit" them. It was a ridiculous request that I obviously refused."

> "James and one of his associates were scheming to trick the police into seizing my personal hardware by claiming it was stolen company property in an attempt to get the signing keys, which wouldn't have worked anyway. I was leaked this information by someone involved with them."

### The account takeovers
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1070352677542879232
> "I need help getting in contact with a Reddit administrator and someone at Twitter able to help. They've made uninformed decisions that are continuing to cause substantial harm to my open source privacy/security work. They took easily disproved lies from Copperhead at face value."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1070367159405047808
> "The open source work was not done for Copperhead under either work contracts or an employment agreement. There was no copyright assignment, and I never granted any formal licenses to them. It was also explicitly agreed that the projects were independently controlled / owned."

### Tax claims
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1229548605054296067
> "It really sucks having the government expecting me to pay taxes on income that I didn't earn. Not only are they taking Copperhead's fraudulent filing at face value, but adding it to the amount that I already paid for the same source of income is just totally screwed up."


### Further reading from Daniel Micay on his Twitter Page

#### The situation with the Twitter Account:
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1157966881682350080
> "Twitter's security engineering and 2-factor authentication is a sham. They literally handed my project's previous account to an scammer despite it being tied to my email and phone number with my app and security key 2FA. They know they're in the wrong and have delayed for a year."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1070369294209273856
> "It used my email and phone number, for years. I moved from a http://copperhead.co email to a http://gmail.com email before the events leading up to things falling apart too. The action Twitter took was rolling it back to the past email to allow Copperhead to seize it."

##### How the accounts were stolen
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1062439759534903296
> "James not only stole the majority of the donations but also the Twitter account representing my projects and security research / engineering. I had renamed it and he tricked Twitter support into handing over my account to him and claims it's a corporate account which it wasn't."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1062445479835783168
> "Twitter support rolled back the email address to the one used months prior (daniel.micay@copperhead.co) for them and then James was able to seize control via grabbing control of all the http://copperhead.co infrastructure since he registered the domain on his personal account."

#### Being pushed out of the project
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1068641901157511168
> "The update notes at https://copperhead.co/android/docs/updates falsely claim that the new incarnation of CopperheadOS has been updated to the latest security patch levels. However, that isn't the case. In reality, it hasn't received the full August, September, October or November security patches."

##### Donaldson and the project
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1095054976991268866
> "They've been falsely claiming that I was kicked out of an open source project before my involvement in Android hardening, which is completely untrue. I left that project on my own accord and remain on good terms with most of the people involved, with a couple notable exceptions."

##### On Copperhead
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1093157375207530496
> "By the way, @_copperj has strategically blocked me on Twitter after I debunked misinformation and lies that he was spreading in replies to his tweets. I'm unable to easily see what he's saying and I cannot directly respond to it. I checked from a logged out browser though."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1068641901157511168
> "The update notes at https://copperhead.co/android/docs/updates falsely claim that the new incarnation of CopperheadOS has been updated to the latest security patch levels. However, that isn't the case. In reality, it hasn't received the full August, September, October or November security patches."

##### Further dealings
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1063169110949822464
> "Please help get the word out about what has happened with Copperhead. They're tricking people into buying an insecure product misrepresented as hardened. It isn't even updated to Android 9 and lacks full security updates. Pixels don't receive full security updates via Android 8."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1063173913167880192
> "They're attempting to bully me into giving them a 10 year exclusive commercial license for my code: https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1062458169903869952. At the moment, their usage is not legal. Companies buying licenses from them DO NOT HAVE A COMMERCIAL LICENSE as Copperhead cannot provide one to them."

##### Bitcoin
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1062432377480208384
> "I've had enough of this and I need your help getting back these donations:
>
> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1062395757263646720
>
> This is theft. Even when the people who donated contact him and demand that donated to support me get passed along, James falsely claims it was donated to support the business."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1036769302358048768
> "Regular reminder that I had no license, copyright or employment agreement with Copperhead. The open source projects are mine and always have been. James Donaldson (@_copperj) is falsely claiming Copperhead owns the sources to the projects I started before the company existed..."

##### Copperhead and copyright
https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1033834699599179776

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1057031286999502849
> "Copperhead is falsely claiming copyright of my code:
>
> https://github.com/CopperheadOS
>
> Everyone buying a device from them or licensing the code from them is in violation of my licenses.
>
> I had no work contracts, employment agreement or copyright / licensing agreement with Copperhead."

https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1033835883374333952
> "He has quite literally pursued business deals with multiply companies and individuals tied to criminal networks that were later arrested due to their phone business. Check out the articles on some of them by @josephfcox. Copperhead with James in control is completely compromised."
