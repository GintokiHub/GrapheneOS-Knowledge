                <a href="#is-it-ready">"Is it ready to be used as a daily driver OS?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Resoundingly yes, Graphene OS is stable and feature-rich enough to be utilized as a daily 
            driver operating system with only one consideration: an app store (F-Droid, Yalp, Google Play) 
            is not included by default to allow the user the choice. An app store can be added by simply 
            downloading, verifying and installing the required .apk.

            <h3 id="update-flashing">
                <a href="#update-flashing">"Do I need to unlock the bootloader to update or flash again?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No. Your phone will automatically download and install the updates when they are released,
            provided an internet connection is available. The update images are provided for those who
            need to download them off of the device for any reason.</p>
            
            <p>Updates are digitally signed by Daniel Micay and verified by the device. Unlocking to update 
            is not needed.</p>

                <a href="#update-on-wifi-only">"Can I set the update client to only download on WiFi?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Yes, under Settings -> System -> Advanced -> System update Settings -> Permitted networks, 
            set it for unmetered networks only to prevent the update client from using up your cellular data 
            plan.</p>
            
            <h3 id="what-apps-included">
                <a href="#what-apps-included">What does the operating system come with?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>"Out of the box", the operating system comes with an app for SMS messages and a Phone app, a 
            search app, Vanadium Browser, Auditor, Mail, Calendar, Photo Gallery, Calculator, Camera, and a 
            File Browser. More apps can always be installed as desired. </p>

                <a href="#what-apps-will-it-run">"What apps will GrapheneOS run?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS will run most apps for Android. Most apps from F-Droid will run. GrapheneOS will 
            run proprietary apps such as Spotify and some banking apps if they are loaded from .apk so long as 
            they do not have a hard dependency on the absent Google Software Frameworks. </p>
            
            <p>Apps that are written unsafely or attempt to violate the security policies that GrapheneOS has put
            in place will be halted immediately, and a notification that the application has stopped working 
            displayed to the user.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Yes, long passphrases consisting of many dictionary words <i>(using the 
            <a href="https://xkcd.com/936">"Correct Horse, Battery Staple"</a> approach)</i> work perfectly 
            fine. The limit is 64 characters.</p>

                off the bat for security or privacy enhancements?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>None. GrapheneOS is designed to be secure by default and requires no tweaking nor custom 
            tuning.</p>
            
            <h3 id="do-you-provide-root">
                <a href="#do-you-provide-root">"Do you provide root?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No, root is not provided. Root is discouraged in a security-focused environment to minimize 
            access, privilege, reduce the attack surface of the applications, and reduce the consequences 
            of user error as much as possible. </p>
                   
            <h3 id="support-vpns">
                <a href="#support-vpns">"Does GrapheneOS support VPNs and VPN apps?"</a>

            <p>Yes. Orbot, OpenVPN for Android, the userspace implementation of WireGuard, and the Private 
            Internet Access VPN app have all been tested and reported working. VPNs can be configured
            under Settings -> Network & Internet -> Advanced -> VPN.</p>

           	</h3>           	
            <p>Support for other devices is planned, but there are a few requirements for full support from 
            Graphene OS. Rather than aim to try to support many devices, GrapheneOS seeks to support only 
            the devices with the best security, and focus on specific devices to ensure that the most 
            attention can be paid to the quality of the code, review, and testing. </p>
            
        	<p>A more detailed answer is in the documentation at the entry under 
        	<a href="https://GrapheneOS.org/#device-support">device support</a>.</p>

            <p>Devices purchased for running GrapheneOS should be <i>bootloader</i> unlocked. Devices that

            flashed.</p>

                operating system installed. Why is this?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>This is normal and expected behaviour, as the phone is now running a different operating 
            system than the factory one installed by the manufacturer. If you see this screen, it is a 
            <i>good sign,</i> as it indicates that the Android Verified Boot is doing its job to 
            verify the software, even though it is different than the factory image. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>If you see this orange screen, the phone is telling you that the boot loader has been left 
            unlocked. This allows persistent changes to be written to the operating system at will. 
            Unlocking the bootloader is one of the steps taken during installation of the operating system, but 
            it is crucially important that as soon as the installation has been finished, the bootloader is 
            locked again immediately. Your phone should never be used if your bootloader is unlocked; doing 
            so switches off Verified Boot.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Linux, Mac, and Windows users should always follow the same process and obtain Android Debug
            Bridge directly from the 
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html">official sources.</a>
            No software needs to be installed, the program simply may be run via the commandline from
            where it is unzipped to.</p> 
            
            <p>Linux users should <i>not</i> utilize the version of Android Debug Bridge packaged by 
            their distro. Not only are these versions often out of date, but often have their versions 
            numbered according to the distro, rather than the official source. 
            <strong>Utilizing an out-of-date version of Fastboot may brick your device.</strong></p>
