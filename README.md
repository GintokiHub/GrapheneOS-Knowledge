# GrapheneOS-Knowledge
This is a short description of some of the knowledge I've collected on GrapheneOS and some common questions I've been asked and my answers to them.

Something I should mention off the bat right now is that **this repository is a rough draft.** Much of the information in it is very work-in-progress, and some of it needs to be looked at. This repository is meant more as a launchpad to invite feedback and pass scrutiny before being sent to the project itself. Some of it could be inaccurate, but it's better that the inaccurate information remain on an obscure and heavily disclaimered backwater git repo than be posted in public venues.

I'm planning to put them into a more cohesive FAQ later.
